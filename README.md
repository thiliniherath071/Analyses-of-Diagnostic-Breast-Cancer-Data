# Analyses-of-Diagnostic-Breast-Cancer-Data
This study identifies the key features for classifying the two breast cancer types: malignant and
benign. The dataset consists of 30 predictor variables, and the most important two features
were selected using a combination of techniques, including t-tests and random forest feature
importance. This approach yields a logistic regression model with excellent interpretability.
Given that malignant is the more severe type, the final model was optimized to maximize the
recall for malignant cases, achieving a recall of 97% and an overall accuracy of 95% on the testing
data.
